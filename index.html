            This was the first time we went on a trip together. I was really
            grateful that you were willing to go with me even though you were so
            busy. Plus you carried the bag even though it was filled with stuff
            I packed. I had a lot of fun with you.

            I think this was after I helped you set up your bed, probably the
            first time we did more hand on stuff then. Idk i was so happy just
            to be spending time with you. And also your elephant pants plus
            shirt combo was so funny.

        I wanted to continue this since it always felt incomplete. A part of me
        is glad that we had that big fight and broke up because of it I became
        more open, more honest. I think you did too. These 2 months after felt
        really good with you, it felt like I was going getting to know you again
        and having the whole butterflies again of meeting you again. Even though
        we aren’t perfect, I can tell that you are trying and so am I. I really
        want this to work, I want you to be in my life. I don’t want to be
        strangers again. Being with you makes me feel safe and I feel so happy
        and comfortable being with you. Even though I am not perfect and often
        burst with emotions, thank you for accepting me for me.

        <br /><br />
        I think these few months were certainly filled with uncertainty, I
        always wanted to be with you even before the break, but I had to think
        about me again. I didn’t want to be thrown away again, and even though
        that thought is still at the back of my mind I think the desire and want
        for you is greater than that. I have thought a lot about it and through
        your actions I can tell you are trying to be better and let go of a lot.
        Our future is so uncertain that that makes me nervous and anxious, but I
        want to do it with you. I want to be with you, good or bad I want you in
        my life. So I guess I am asking if you want it too, last chance to back
        out.

        <br /><br />
        I guess what I am trying to do today is a make-up birthday for what I
        actually wanted to do with you that day. So ig Happy 23th Birthday baby,
        I love you so much and thank you for trying to be better and accepting
        me for being incomplete as well.
