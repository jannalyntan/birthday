            This was the first time we went on a trip together. I was really
            grateful that you were willing to go with me even though you were so
            busy. Plus you carried the bag even though it was filled with stuff
            I packed. I had a lot of fun with you.

            I think this was after I helped you set up your bed, probably the
            first time we did more hand on stuff then. Idk i was so happy just
            to be spending time with you. And also your elephant pants plus
            shirt combo was so funny.
